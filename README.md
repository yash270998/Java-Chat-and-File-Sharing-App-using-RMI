# Java-Chat-and-File-Sharing-App-using-RMI

This application is purely based on RMI. Using RMI, we create two fucntionalities into this app.
The first is chatting. You can connect to any server with a given IP address and communicate.
The second is file sharing. All the server files are displayed into the GUI. All the client
has to do is type in the file name and download it from the server.

All the steps are given in detail in the Chat and file sharing app Word Document.
You can simply read the instructions to start this app and run it efficiently.
